✅Next.js is a React-based framework that enables developers to build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. 
It offers powerful features like server-side rendering (SSR), 
static site generation (SSG), and API routes, making it suitable for modern web development.

✅TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, interfaces, and other advanced features to enhance the development experience, 
improve code quality, and make debugging easier. 
It compiles to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with all JavaScript runtimes.

✅TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design directly in the markup by using pre-defined classes. 
This approach provides flexibility, faster development, 
and better maintainability compared to traditional CSS or component-based frameworks.

Using Next.js with TypeScript provides type safety, 
improved code quality, and enhanced developer experience when building modern web applications. 
Next.js is a React-based framework for server-rendered, static, 
and hybrid web applications, and TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with static typing.

 Unlike traditional relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), MongoDB uses a document-oriented model, storing data in JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).

 Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. 
 It provides a structured and convenient way to interact with MongoDB by defining schemas and models for your data.
